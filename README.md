-- Wave2MusicApp --

I submitted this AI voice transforming app to the Bolt Competition 2025. 
It has a interface to record your vocals, organize tracks and projects, add effects and have AI transform your track into a music style like orchestra, jazz, or rock song snippet. 

Its a way to see your song ideas come to life. 
It allows for multiple projects, effects and AI transofrmations
Theres also the ability to export the music file as a .wav file 

Looking to add a feature to allow for the AI to transform vocal recording note for note to a individual instrument as well as to a certain music style.
